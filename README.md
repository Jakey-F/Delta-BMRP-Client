# Delta-BMRP-Client
If your sole purpose in life is to play dBMRP, you can drag & drop everything from `delta-bmrp-client-main` into your `garrysmod` folder.  
If you only want the gamemode specific files, just put `delta-bmrp-client-main/gamemodes/dbmrp` in your `garrysmod/gamemodes` folder, et voila!

These files do not contain any server code that is not otherwise publicly available.
